                <h2>Singer and Songwriter</h2>
                <p>Louis William Tomlinson is an English pop singer, one of the members of the boy band ‘One Direction’. A young and dynamic performer, he is the heartthrob of millions of teenage girls across the globe and is especially very popular in his native England. He was exposed to the show business at a young age. When he was 11, his baby sisters landed minor roles on the television comedy ‘Fat Friends’ and he accompanied them to the sets where he was also cast as an extra. Excited after this incident, he began taking acting lessons and started appearing on television dramas in small roles. Good looking and talented, he was also interested in singing and songwriting. Throughout his school days he remained active in school musical productions and did not focus much on academics. He auditioned for the seventh series of the singing competition ‘The X Factor’ in 2010. He successfully cleared the initial rounds but was eliminated before the final round. However, the judges recognized his potential and teamed him up with four other participants to form a group act. The group, which also included Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne and Zayn Malik, adopted the name One Direction and clinched a deal with Simon Cowell's music label. The group quickly gained popularity in the UK and before long became internationally famous as well.

                    He was born as Louis Troy Austin on 24 December 1991 in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England to Johannah Poulston and Troy Austin. His parents split up when he was just a week old. His mother later married Mark Tomlinson and Louis took on his stepfather’s surname.
                    
                    He studied at the Hayfield School before moving on to Hall Cross School. He was not much inclined towards academics. He loved singing and acting, and was very active in his high school musical productions. He also took acting lessons and played the lead role of Danny Zuko in the Hall Cross musical production of ‘Grease’. As a young boy he received the chance to play small parts on the television dramas ‘If I Had You’ and ‘Waterloo Road’.
